## lazy c4t
 
Tired of typing the same Nmap commands for every HTB box? So was I!

LazyCat was born out of pure frustration during those late-night HTB sessions. Stop wasting time on repetitive scanning and focus on what actually matters - getting root!


## Why Your Life Just Got Better

- Eliminates manual port extraction between scans
- Ensures consistent scanning methodology
- Saves time during initial reconnaissance 
- Comprehensive coverage with both TCP and UDP scanning
